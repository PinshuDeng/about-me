        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>
            Music and animation are two areas that truly captivate me. From a young age, I developed a deep love for these creative forms of expression, and they continue to play a significant role in my life. I enjoy listening to various genres of music, from Rock Music to Light Music. Music has the power to evoke emotions, inspire creativity, and transport me to different worlds. It is a special language that connects people all over the world.

            Animation, on the other hand, fascinates me with its ability to tell compelling stories and create visually stunning worlds. Whether it's traditional hand-drawn animation or computer-generated graphics, I appreciate the artistry and craftsmanship behind each frame. It's a medium that allows imagination to come to life, the embodiment of an incredible world.
